Let's assume a model was trained for a **_Binary Classification_** task, meaning that every item in the dataset has a ground-truth value of 1 or 0. To make it easier to understand, let's pretend this model is trying to predict whether or not someone has a disease. A confusion matrix gives you the following information: \n", "\n", "**_True Positives (TP)_**: The number of observations where the model predicted the person has the disease (1), and they actually do have the disease (1).\n", "\n", "**_True Negatives (TN)_**: The number of observations where the model predicted the person is healthy (0), and they are actually healthy (0).\n", "\n", "**_False Positives (FP)_**: The number of observations where the model predicted the person has the disease (1), but they are actually healthy (0). \n", "\n", "**_False Negatives (FN)_**: The number of observations where the model predicted the person is healthy (0), but they actually have the disease (1).\n", "\n", "Let's take a look at an example confusion matrix:\n", "\n", "<img src='https://curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/data-science/images/rf-conf-matrix.png'>\n", "\n", "As you can see, one axis of the confusion matrix represents the ground-truth value of the items the model made predictions on, while the other axis represents the labels predicted by the classifier. To read a confusion matrix, look at the intersection of each row and column to tell what each cell represents. For instance, in the example above, the bottom right square represents _True Positives_, because it is the intersection of \"True Label: 1\" row and the \"Predicted Label: 1\" column. \n", "\n", "Take another look at the diagram above and see if you can figure out which cells represent TN, FP, and FN.

Since our model is multi-categorical, we may also be interested in exactly **_how_** a model was incorrect with certain predictions. For instance, by looking at \\[4, 19\\], you can conclude that 33 articles that were of category _talk.politics.misc_ were incorrectly classified as _talk.politics.guns_.  Note that when viewed through the lens of the *talk.politics.misc*, these are **_False Negatives_** -- our model said they weren't about this topic, and they were.
